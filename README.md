## Update 1/9/17

This repository is a fork of the original valnet NRP. I've since taken the ideas in this software and incorporated them into [this plugin](https://github.com/christroutner/rpiovn) for [ConnextCMS](http://connextcms.com) and put them into practice with the Raspberry Pi Open Value Network ([RPiOVN](http://rpiovn.com)). If you want to check out the back end of this new software, [sign up for an account on RPiOVN](http://rpiovn.org/createaccount).

## Fork 03/21/16 CT
I forked this so that I have a copy of an unchanging version of the software. I plan to use this fork as a test-bed for my own business ideas.

A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with http://www.sensorica.co/ , a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.  Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.

Background on Value Networks: http://www.sensorica.co/value-networks

The prototype used the https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account starter project, built on the Django framework.

See /docs/install.txt for developer installation instructions or [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
